# Tripadvisor website 

Iâ€™ve developed a TripAdvisor-inspired website using HTML and CSS to showcase my front-end development skills. This project replicates the clean, and user-friendly layout of the popular travel platform.

ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights:

ðŸš€Clean and semantic HTML structure
Modern CSS styling with Flexbox alignment.

ðŸš€Eye-catching sections showcasing destinations, travel highlights, and navigation.

ðŸš€This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of web design principles and create a visually appealing user interface.

ðŸ¤—Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts! Check it out and feel free to connect to discuss web development, design, or any feedback you have.
